Reasonable worst case - Discussed with Jon Day from CLCC 15/06/23. The indemnity has similarities to D&O policies provided to companies in the private sector. D&O insurance typically provides cover to directors and officials of companies for €œwrongful acts€ (i.e. not acting in the interest of the company or negligence). 

Severity: Large D&O claims can be in the order of £100ms. This is supported by public info which provides a sense of scale. Larger claims are possible but for our purposes could be considered beyond a 1 in 100-year type event given the low frequency of such claims. On a absolute maximum exposure basis, the amounts could be far larger and in the order of £bns. For purchase protection/warranty type arrangements the maximum exposure could potentially be based on the size of the transactions/arrangement. Note HMT indemnities are likely to be narrower than that of coverage provided by D&O policies and the claims information includes the US market which tends to be more litigious.

Frequency: There are a low number of D&O claims across the market each year €“ in the order of 100s per year. In a 1 in 100 type scenario, propose 1 large claim or a handful of average claims would be appropriate.

Therefore, any claims brought against the bank on these grounds would be meritless, meaning the likelihood of their success (and therefore of the liability crystallising) is seen to be exceptionally low.

431,"National Employment Savings Trust (NEST
The Pension Schemes Act 2017 introduced the definition of a Master Trust and signalled the start of a robust new authorisation and supervision regime, administered by the Pensions Regulator to ensure that Master Trusts being used for automatic enrolment are safe for the many millions of people now saving in these schemes.  To be able to operate as a Master Trust (MT), of which Nest is one, schemes are required to meet five authorisation criteria prescribed in the 2017 Act.
One of the criteria is that the scheme must be financially sustainable. This means that in the event of a triggering event, an event that would put the scheme at risk of needing to wind up, the scheme must hold sufficient financial reserves to cover its gradual closure, without putting these additional costs onto scheme members.
Due to the nature of its financial arrangements with government Nest, which has been an authorised MT scheme since 2019, is unable to build up the financial reserves needed to meet the financial sustainability criteria. Specifically, this is to hold sufficient funds to meet running costs for 24 months and any one-off costs associated with scheme closure. Using figures produced by Nest for The Pensions Regulator If a triggering event was to occur, then the maximum size of the contingent liability required to be made available to Nest would be £329 million.  This was the amount estimated by Nest in 2019, subsequently restated and accepted by The Pension Regulator. Since then and prior to entering the supervisory process the amount of the liability is reviewed annually.
The Department has estimated that the risk of full crystallisation as remote (at £16.45 million (5%). The contingent liability is underwritten through a €˜Letter of Comfort€™ in order that Nest can comply with the Master Trust supervisory regime which came into effect in October 2020.",2019-04-01,2034-03-01,"£329,000,000.00",£10m to £50m,1% to 5%,0,Yes,1320000,Indemnity - Inter-Public Sector Indemnity,Public Corporation,Section K,Section K,Major Economic or Financial Downturn,Quantifiable,Remote Core,Contact - Emma harrison,Ongoing,J,2023,Core," £10,000,000.00 "," £30,000,000.00 "," £50,000,000.00 ",0.01,0.025,0.05,Public,£5m to £10m,£10m to £50m," £5,000,000.00 "," £7,500,000.00 "," £10,000,000.00 "," £10,000,000.00 "," £30,000,000.00 "," £50,000,000.00 ",14.92,10.92," £916,000.00 "," £2,747,000.00 "," £4,579,000.00 "," £8,225,000.00 "

Distinct from legal cases, the Department acknowledges that administrative errors (termed offcial error) by its staff will sometimes result in the underpayment of benefit. Where underpayments relating to offcial error are identifed, we pay arrears in full at the earliest opportunity. 
Through annual review of fraud and error statistics, the Department has an estimate of offcial error both for the current year (see note 18), and prior years from equivalent exercises. These estimates are based on statistical samples; as a result the Department 
does not hold a full list of underpaid benefts cases that it can correct. The Department cannot quantify the cumulative historic liability which may exist due to limitations in data. Therefore, a contingent liability exists for underpayments not yet found and 
corrected. The measures reported in the Incorrect Payments notes show an estimate of underpayments made in the reporting year. At present there is no mechanism by which we can calculate the value of historic offcial error corrected in year, to support an overall 
quantifcation of the outstanding liability.

The liabilities are being managed by robustly defending the cases using the government legal service. At this time we are not able to quantify the potential loss as preliminary  hearings have not been held and we do not know the exact allegations we will be defending. Ultimately it is HRD/David Williams sign off in terms of managing this liability. Update Elizabeth Harrison 5/5/20  - There are currently 6 cases.            Met with K Joomaye (HR) 19/1/21 to discuss outstanding cases.  Further meeting arranged for w/c 22/1/21 to discuss year end position.  Final list of live cases agreed. 

21/22 YE - Khalid Joomaye (who is the HR ET€™s contact) has also been in touch to establish who has what liability, he has been referred to Eva.Siwiak-Jaszek@dhsc.gov.uk and andrew.grimley@dhsc.gov.uk  for clarification.

This is all related to the different agencies that have either joined DHSC (such as PHE) or have had changes in structure such as staff from NHSPP & SCG.

Update  from HR (Frances Mclaren) 14.06.2022 - The approach we have agreed with Camilla is that all ET cases raised prior to the transition to UKHSA will be DHSC€™s responsibility and risk.  Those raised post transition will sit with UKHSA.

If this happens then this will need funding by DH as part of the remaining Contingent Liability.
As a result of reducing the contract price DH was liable and paid the redundancy costs of a member of staff. There is still ongoing liability for a number of staff.

This liability is on-going until a decision is made about the future of the programmes originally pushed out to NHS Employers.  If the decision is to continue / re-procure, then the liability will continue to refresh and effectively be a recurring decision.  There is no indication of a change in policy at present, and therefore we have sent the end date for the liability as 2033.

21/2 YE- As far as the DD was aware this still existsed, however there was a question over if the responsibility should still sit with them or in more of a HR type space. Stephen has very few details about this. 1 individual who was part of the 16 staff who transferred over has moved to another team in the same directorate, another has moved elsewhere in DHSC and 1 person has left DHSC. Therefore this is likely to reduce the value on the contingent liability for the individual who has left although Stepehn was not aware of how much that would be as he didn't have the details of what makes up the contingent liability.

However, some of the potential claimants may also be members of the NHS Pension Scheme. The BSA should have more up to date contact information for these people, so may be able to data match between the IB caseload and Pension Scheme membership to identify and contact potential claimants. This won€™t change the value of the liability as at 31st March 2021.

It may be more likely that we can put claims into payment where people are also Pension Scheme members because BSA are more likely to have up to date contact details for these people. Potential claimants who are not Pension Scheme members are less likely to have their benefits put into payment as BSA have no way of contacting them.

It might be best for BSA to reassess the likelihood of claims coming forward once they have done the data matching with Pension Scheme records  €¢Adam Stuart update 5/5/21 	€œAny changes in respect of the liability?

However, it should be noted that this only relates to 15 of the 16 LGPS in which CQC has active membership and does not include an estimate for Teesside Pension Funds €“ the largest fund by CQC active membership which is currently in excess of 350 members of staff and cessation is not expected to crystallise in the short/medium term.

Contributions paid by CQC include both contributions as a percentage of payroll and lump sum deficit payments €“ these are set on a triennial basis, the last of which was in 2016, and were set by each fund to recover the deficit over a 3-7 year period.

A contingent liability will ensure that CQC continues to report its pension deficit provision in accordance with the FReM but also gives consideration for the potential liabilities that may be incurred in excess of this deficit provision in the event of cessation ahead of the net deficit being recovered through normal contributions.

The most likely trigger for the liability to crystallise is when the last active member ceases participation in the fund i.e. when the individual leaves employment with CQC. All funds are closed to new members.   Surrey Pension Fund Update: We had the last member of the scheme leaving CQC on the grounds of retirement in September 2019.

517,"NLB is a historic participating employer in the MNRPF. Liability is for any deficit contributions should the fund not be able to meet its future commitments. Potential for further future claims will depend on collection of debt from other participating employers and performance of the scheme.   The actuarial valuation of the Fund as at 31 March 2020 revealed a funding shortfall of £96m.  The funding shortfall was expected to be eliminated by 31 March 2027.  Subsequent valuations will, in normal circumstances, be carried out every three years.  During October 2021 the trustees advised participating employers of two material issues which may add circa £220m to the fund liabilities.  The estimate in February 2022 remains at around £220m.    Pension fund performance will be contingent on stock market investments, due to current climate (Worldwide Coronavirus and Trade/Oil price volatility) the pension fund may not perform as described in order to meet the shortfall.  Ongoing monitoring has shown many employers have withstood the impact of Covid-19 and Brexit well but new strains of Covid-19, cost inflation, macro-economic uncertainty and climate related transition risks are causing additional volatility and longer term risk to the employer covenant. The next triennial actuarial valuation of the MNRPF is due as at 31 March 2023 and the impact of the potential additional liabilities arising from Project Delta, along with the resolution of the Project Greenwich liabilities, will obviously be a major concern for employers.",1979-01-01,2100-04-01,"£2,000,000.00",< £1m,< 1%,772,No,0,Guarantee - Pension Guarantee,Mixed outside Government,Mixed,Mixed,No Exposure to Listed Risks,Unquantifiable,Remote ALB,,Ongoing,F,2023,Core, £-   ," £500,000.00 "," £1,000,000.00 ",0,0.005,0.01,Private,< £1m,< £1m, £-   ," £500,000.00 "," £1,000,000.00 ", £-   ," £500,000.00 "," £1,000,000.00 ",121.25,77, £-   ," £6,000.00 "," £13,000.00 "," £10,000.00 "
518,"A large proportion of NLB's estate is situated on cliff edges or located on rock reefs with affected by rising sea levels.  Regular surveys are carried out to assess the stability of structures and estimate their life span.  The majority of NLB's estate is deemed low risk of cliff erosion or rising sea levels causing catastrophic damage.  However, three sites have been identified as having an increased raised degree of risk that may demand a currently unquantified level of investment. 
1.      Copinsay - The lighthouse is built on an unstable cliff, which we are currently monitoring.  Further deterioration of the cliff face through coastal erosion could result in structural damage.
2.      Firth's Voe - The lighthouse sits on top of a Scheduled Ancient Monument and coastal erosion is creating a cave under the monument and lighthouse by wearing away the existing erosion protection structure and the original strata under the lighthouse. This could result in movement or collapse of the lighthouse before we move it to a new position in circa 2026.
3.      Loch Ryan - The lighthouse is only one metre above sea level. A previous erosion protection system was installed and is now starting to erode and to be undermined, this could lead to movement or collapse of the lighthouse.  
All NLBs lighthouse properties are self-insured, the risks include; liability for AToN failure if not notified to mariners in time to avoid a catastrophic collision with a vessel and the seabed/rock; liability for environmental impact of the failure of the structure, although there may or may not be a legal obligation to return the ruined cliff/beach/seabed back to its original state, there may be a moral obligation to do so and the clean-up exercise could be costly. Furthermore there may be, in an extreme case, an injury caused to a member of staff and/or the public. we have had a report from our Framework Consultant, Fairhurst, looking at sea level rise, wave actin, lightning strikes, etc due to climate change and we have assigned a RAG to all lighthouse stations, where appropriate we will carry out relevant mitigations at future Capital refurbishment projects and continue to monitor for any erosion/deterioration. We are also looking to get a framework contract to undertake regular, 5 yearly drone photogrammetry and 3D Lidar point cloud cliff and station surveys which can then be overlaid to see what level of movement is being experienced so that we can become more proactive in our planning for erosion mitigations.

The CAZ agreement is a legal agreement for the supply of CAZ central services (a digital vehicle checker, payments and accounts service and a contact centre for users and local authorities). As a supplier, the SoS is therefore liable for a failure to provide the CAZ Central Service to the required service levels.   These agreements have a contingent liability for HMG attached to them capped at £5M and there is a reciprocal contingent liability £5m cap for the local authority. We have engaged with TOA and our HMT spending team and discussed the agreement with them, they have confirmed to us that this does not require reporting to Parliament as it is considered in the normal course of business under Managing Public Money. Although the agreement has been negotiated by JAQU we have taken advice and as the signatory is DfT, therefore the contingent liability will also sit with DfT.

557,"All railways were built using statutory powers and with that goes a statutory liability for every structure that was built. The liability for the live railway now vests with Network Rail. For all railways that did not transfer to NR (eg the Beeching cuts) the ultimate statutory liability now vests with DfT. For example if a bridge was sold in 1970 and the purchaser defaults on the repairing and maintenance obligations imposed on it at the time of sale (eg by going bust) then the responsibility for that bridge reverts to DfT. 

Group Property have suggested two alternative quantifications: one based on the costs of demolition/infilling (which would remove all further risk); the other based on an average annual maintenance cost for the €œburdensome€ structures.
€¢ The cost of demolition/infilling has a range of £1bn-£4bn, due to uncertainty about the numbers that are a) bridges; b) culverts, walls, abutments etc; or c) tunnels and viaducts.
€¢ The average annual maintenance cost for the €œburdensome€ structures is approximately £8m, which can be extrapolated to £61.5m for the 24,000 structures. The present value of £61.5m p.a. in perpetuity would be £2bn, using the discount rates in the Green Book (3.5% for years 1-30; 3% for years 31-75; 2.5% thereafter).

The annual maintenance cost of the Historical Railways Estate (formerly known as the €œburdensome estate€), comprising 3,100 assets, is now £13m (albeit that the actual budget was limited to £9m) which equates to an average of £4,193 per assets.  This can now be extrapolated to £100.6m for the 24,000 structures which should supersede the earlier figure of £61.5m.

Legal team provided a briefing on BTP€™s potential liability under the Human Rights Act 1998 and in negligence following the publication of Volume 1 which criticised BTP, SMG and Showsec.  We have received advice from Lord Faulks QC. Counsel considers that BTP will have potential vulnerability in any civil claims in negligence and under the Human Rights Act 1998. There is substantial legal argument that could be made to defeat such claims but no guarantee they would succeed. Consideration will be given to appropriate strategies to conclude the potential civil claims at the earliest opportunity in an effort to minimise legal expenditure. Travellers (insurers) have confirmed that coverage will be provided for any personal injury. We therefore hope that this will limit cost exposure to BTP.

582,"We currently operate Royal Sovereign lighthouse: Due to technological advances and structural degradation, the decision has previously been taken to decommission the lighthouse and remove the top platform and pillar of the structure.

The structure itself is made of three parts; the platform, the tower, and the base. The original scope of the project to remove the lighthouse was to remove the entire structure. However, it has become clear that the removal of the base contains several complexities that only became clear upon investigation, which significantly raise the cost of the project, and therefore the intention of the decommissioning project is now to only remove the platform and the tower while continue to securing the safety of the mariner by marking the retained base. Following the approval by the Board and ongoing liaison with the Department for Transport the decommissioning provision removal of the platform and the tower has been provided for in our accounts for up to a value of £9.5m. It should be noted that whilst the platform and tower would provide a risk for shipping and therefore require removal now, the base is sufficiently below the water level to provide far less of a risk and can be safely marked.

We intend now to include the removal of the base as a contingent liability in our accounts. The sea bed that the base sits on is leased to us on a lease that expires in 2133 by Crown Estates, so there is the potential in the future for us to be required to remove the base at the end of the lease. Our view is that this lability is contingent for the following reasons:-

€¢ Timing €“ any attempt to remove the base could occur in a period of over 100 years.
€¢ The Lease €“ Trinity House€™s position would be to extend the lease, indefinitely if possible. Based on past engagement with the Crown Estates, the lessor, would agree to this (the land has no value to them as it is part of the seabed). However, it is extremely unlikely that they would be willing to enter negotiations now given the lease still has 111 years to run.
€¢ Cost €“ the cost of any removal is extremely subjective, and is likely to change dependent on technological advances.
€¢ Nature of the site €“ The seabed that the base sits on is actively growing, and therefore there is the potential that the base becomes buried. This could mean that the site is returned to its natural condition without the removal of the base.
€¢ Risk €“ Whilst the platform and the tower do provide a risk to shipping if not removed, the risk of the base can be managed by marking with a buoy.

Whilst it is not beyond possible that, ultimately, a financial award could be made against the Trust, the Trust€™s contracts with its third party providers, seek to place liability very firmly on the third party providing the services. It is therefore highly unlikely that the Trust would agree voluntarily to make a payment to settle the matter. Currently, the matter is in the hands of the Trust€™s insurers. The Trust€™s position is that if this matter proceeds, the Trust would look to its insurers both to conduct the matter and indemnify the Trust under the terms of the Insurance. Notification of a possible claim was received in January 2023 and notified to the insurers immediately. No formal claim had been notified before that date. The view of the incident taken by the Trust€™s contractors at the time, was that it did not merit elevating it within the Trust, so the insurers were not notified at that point. The position taken is that any responsibility for the incident lies not with the Trust, but with the Trust€™s third party contractors, who were directly involved in providing the experience that led to the incident, primarily The Challenge Network (TCN) and its subcontractors. The details for TCN have been provided to the young person's lawyer.",Ongoing,C,2023,Core, £-   ," £500,000.00 "," £1,000,000.00 ",0.1,0.175,0.25,Private,< £1m,< £1m, £-   ," £500,000.00 "," £1,000,000.00 ", £-   ," £500,000.00 "," £1,000,000.00 ",0.5,0.25, £-   ," £2,000,000.00 "," £4,000,000.00 "," £10,500.00 "

This required a number of employees to be transferred out of the Museum's employment and into the employment of Servest under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006. These employees had to be enrolled by the new employter into a pension scheme broadly comparable to the Civil Service Pension scheme which they were enrolled in whilst in the Museum's employment. The contract was retendered and awarded to Total Support Services Ltd in July 2016 which under the New Fair Deal Policy triggered the opportunity for the transferred staff to transfer the pension benefirs earned in the Servest scheme back into the Civil Service Pension scheme. As the contracting authority, the Natural History Museum will have a liability to pay the shortfall between the transfer in and transfer out values. The value of the liability will depend on negotiation with the Servest scheme provider and the number of individuals who will take up the option to transfer. The Government Actuary's Department have been engaged to undertake this process on the Museum's behalf and the amount is expected to be settled in April 2023.

Note on end date: we do not know. End 2024 is merely a guess.
Note on reasonable worst case: This is an unquantifiable liability, since the claimant have been unable to explain the basis of their calculations. The reasonable worst case scenario is based on a claim of about £9.4m per claimant, with 4 ""live""  claimants and 33 potential further claimants, giving a figure of c.£350m.
Note on estimated expected loss: We are too early in the legal proceedings to give an informed view. For the range selected (£10m to £50m), this assumes that the court rules in the claimant's favour for the 3 live, and that the liability is between £3.33m and £9.4m per claimant (£9.4m is the claim figure). As above, we cannot comment on the likely claim volume - no basis of the calculation - and further clarification is being sought from the claimant's legal representatives.
